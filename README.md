![Image of shopping cart](/mnt/c/Users/krisw/Desktop/gitHub/tech-challenges/aws-shopping-list/public/images/readme-image.jpg)

A simple shopping list app build with the following tech:

* React & node.js
* AWS Lambda, API Gateway and RDS(mySQL)

I used React because I am familar with the framework. I knew deploying to AWS would be the challenge so wanted to focus most my time on the backend deployment. I used a relational database as it is a simple application with small data storage demands so didn't feel it needed over-engineered.

# How to install and deploy

In your CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/krisjwood/aws-shopping-list.git
npm install // installs dependencies

```

```javascript
if (hungry) {
